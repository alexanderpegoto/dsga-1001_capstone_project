## Q8. Build a regression model predicting average ratings from all 
## tags (the ones in the rmpCapstoneTags.csv) file. Make sure to 
## include the R2 and RMSE of this model. Which of these tags is most
## strongly predictive of average rating? Hint: Make sure to address 
## collinearity concerns. Also comment on how this model compares 
## to the previous one.

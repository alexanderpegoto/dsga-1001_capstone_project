## Q4. Is there a gender difference in the tags awarded by students? 
## Make sure to teach each of the 20 tags for a potential gender 
## difference and report which of them exhibit a statistically 
## significant different. Comment on the 3 most gendered 
## (lowest p-value) and least gendered (highest p-value) tags.


## Q8. Build a regression model predicting average ratings from all 
## tags (the ones in the rmpCapstoneTags.csv) file. Make sure to 
## include the R2 and RMSE of this model. Which of these tags is most
## strongly predictive of average rating? Hint: Make sure to address 
## collinearity concerns. Also comment on how this model compares 
## to the previous one.
